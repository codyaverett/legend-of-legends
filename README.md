# Legends of Legend

A 2D side-scrolling action game where humanity's last hope pilots giant mechs to defend Earth against colossal Kaiju emerging from the ocean depths.

## Game Features

- **Dual Gameplay Modes**: Switch between on-foot exploration and piloting massive Titan mechs
- **Destructible Environments**: Every building, mountain, and structure can be destroyed with realistic voxel-based physics
- **Dynamic Camera System**: Seamless zoom transitions from intimate on-foot sequences to tactical mech combat
- **Strategic Defense Building**: Construct automated defenses between Kaiju attacks
- **Narrative Choices**: Discover the truth behind the invasion and decide the fate of two civilizations

## Technical Features

- Built with Rust 2024 and SDL2 for maximum performance and safety
- Modular "System of Systems" architecture for extensibility
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Pixel art aesthetic with modern particle effects
- Entity Component System (ECS) for efficient game object management

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75 or later
- SDL2 development libraries

#### Installing SDL2
